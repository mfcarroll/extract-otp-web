/*
  1. Remove the default outline for mouse-click focus on our navigable elements.
     This is a common practice, but we will add a better one back.
  2. Apply a strong, visible outline ONLY for keyboard focus (:focus-visible).
     - The outline is thick and high-contrast.
     - The outline-offset prevents it from overlapping the element's border.
